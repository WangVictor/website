I have interests in optimisation methods, inverse problems, and machine learning. I received my PhD in Applied Mathemtics from University of Cambridge, supervised by Martin Benning, and Carola-Bibiane Sch√∂nlieb. My areas of study were non-smooth optimisation, deep neural networks, inverse problems and regularisation.
